# 🌿 Week 2 Progress – Plant Disease Detection

### 📅 Milestone
60% Completion

### 🧩 Work Done
- Implemented base CNN architecture using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Created automatic 80/20 train-validation split.
- Trained model for 15 epochs on ~10,479 training and 2,617 validation images.
- Achieved **96.9% validation accuracy**.
- Added augmentation, normalization, and dropout (0.3).
- Saved model `cnn_model_v1.h5` and training plot `accuracy_loss_plot.png`.

### 📊 Results
| Metric | Value |
|:-------|:------:|
| Training Accuracy | 96.7% |
| Validation Accuracy | 96.9% |
| Validation Loss | 0.10 |

### 🧠 Next Steps (Week 3)
- Integrate transfer learning (MobileNetV2)
- Evaluate model with test data and confusion matrix
- Add Grad-CAM visualization
- Deploy using Streamlit
