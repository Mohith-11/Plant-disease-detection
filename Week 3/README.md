# Plant Disease Detection

This project aims to detect plant diseases using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on a dataset of various plant diseases and can classify images of plants to identify potential diseases.

## Project Structure

- **week 3/**: Contains the Jupyter notebook `plant_disease_week3.ipynb` which includes code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.
- **data/**: This folder is intended to store datasets used for training and validation of the model.
- **models/**: This folder is intended to store saved model files, such as trained weights or architecture definitions.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the Python packages required to run the project, including libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, and any other dependencies.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Plant-disease-detection
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Place your dataset in the `data/` folder.

## Usage

To run the Jupyter notebook for plant disease detection, navigate to the `week 3/` directory and open `plant_disease_week3.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and validation is stored in the `data/` folder. Ensure that the dataset is organized correctly for the model to access it.

## Model

The model architecture is defined in the Jupyter notebook. It utilizes a CNN for image classification tasks related to plant diseases.
